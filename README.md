# Incredibot
A simple discord bot that I use for my personal server with my friends. You can use it if you want!

There is no real rhyme or reasoning behind the features that I implement; I just do what I want to.

## Quick Start
```bash
$ git clone "https://www.github.com/FeistyKit/incredibot.git"
$ cd incredibot
$ cargo build --release
$ ./target/release/incredibot <path to file that contains discord authentication token> &
```
Depends on OpenSSL and requires [rust](https://rustup.rs/) to run.
